## Here is the list of things which can be done:

1. Add Dockerfile
2. Add preferences for each editor in common directory to fix some coding policy
3. Enrich information for Employees. Maybe add management system?
4. Improve exception handling
5. Maybe add some specific caching layer depending on the use of that service
